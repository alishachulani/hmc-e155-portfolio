This week, no lab was due which was really nice to recoup from a tough first few weeks and catch up on everything I needed to do. I want to keep the reflection short this week because I don't have a lot to reflect on for MicroPs this week, but overall I am learning the importance of taking breaks especially when there are many tough and long weeks in consecutive. I also learned about the importance of taking breaks in the middle of tough and long labs - which I talked about in my previous reflection.

I have to say I really appreciate the midway break for the labs and maybe this could be implemented for future years? This is a tough time for most students with clinic, midterms, etc, and also it's flu season...just a thought!
