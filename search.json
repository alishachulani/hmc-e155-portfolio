    "text": "The goals of this lab were to fully solder and set up our boards for the rest of the semester, and test that everything was working correctly. First, I soldered surface mount pieces, then the through hole technology to the PCB before testing that everything powered correctly. Then, I tested the LEDs and connections through a simple blinking program. Finally, I programmed a 7-segment display to display digits 0-F.\nFor this report, I will focus on the 7-segment display as the main design goal. Schematics are shown below.\n\n\n\nSchematic of 7-segment display and LEDs with pins labeled\n\n\nTo design the 7-bit display, I first looked at the datasheets to get acquainted with the 7-bit display we were provided with. I needed to get acquainted with the hardware pieces first, as I knew the coding bit of it would be relatively straightforward (just pushing 1s and 0s through to the segments based on switch inputs - an always_comb block). This proved to be the hardest step for me because I struggled to sift through the datasheet to understand exactly how things should be wired.\nThe coding was relatively straightforward. A block diagram is shown below. \nTo verify that the design was behaving as expected, I simply used the switches to toggle through all 17 options. I had some problems with wiring in the exact correct way, so based off of this, I switched around some of the wiring to have the display be accurate. My debug method for the wires was mostly guess and check though, which would only be a reasonable approach for a project that is as small as this one.\nThe design meets all requirements. The 7-segment display light up according to bit switch inputs, and the LEDs on the side of the board also light up corresponding to and and xor gates.\nAs part of an excellence requirement, I inspected the datasheet further to find desired voltage and current for each segment, then performed simple V=iR algebra to find a resistor value that would make each segment light up at the same brightness.\n\n\n\nCalculations for resistor values\n\n\nLastly, I forced all of the possible switch values to simulate that the 7 segment display was working correctly for excellence requirements.\n\n\n\nWave forms for forced values\n\n\nI spent about 12 hours working on this lab."

    "text": "This week, we worked on Lab 1, where we soldered and assembled our boards and tested it by making LED sequences and powering a 7-segment display.\nSome learnings I had for this week:\nFirst, START EARLY! I wouldn’t even say I started late persay, but I feel like I could have eased more stress just by alloting more time earlier to prep for the rest of the week. For example, I started soldering my board over the weekend, but did not anticipate how difficult I would find it and thus, how much time it would take. While I still had plenty of time to finish the lab, it would have been good for me to go in a little earlier to gauge.\nSecond, work with other people! Just having friends around me in the lab eased stress because we could struggle together. We could also bounce ideas off each other when things were going wrong, and overall just made the experience more enjoyable. It was also fun to achieve little bits of the lab when I had a friend to celebtrate little wins with.\nLastly, trust the process - the process of building block diagrams and really following the design process through actually helped a lot. At first, I thought I could skip some setup steps and side tutorials in the lab to save some time, but when I got confused later on it just ended up taking more time for me to hunt for answers. I think spreading the lab out would also help with this so I wouldn’t feel so strapped for time and would be ok with going through each of the smaller steps.\nThanks for reading this reflection! Looking forward to next week!"
