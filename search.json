    "text": "This week, we worked on Lab 3, where we programmed a keypad to display numbers on a double 7-segment display (same display as last week).\nThis week’s lab was pretty up and down for me. There were times where I was super confuident in what I was doing and felt like I had a solid grip on the concepts, and other times where I felt like nothing in the lab made any sense and I felt so lost and overwhelmed on how to address certain issues.\nHowever, this was a lesson of patience and debugging for me. I actually felt pretty confident as I was getting the implementation set up - once I had a general understanding of the lab and had completed a thorough planning phase with block diagrams and schematics, the SystemVerilog writing and simulating went relatively smoothly. There were, of course, debugging stages that needed to occur since obviously everything wasn’t perfect the first time, but these were expected and I was able to overcome them with normal effort.\nSimilarly, switching over my design to hardware was also somewhat painless. Some debugging needed here and there, but all expected and at a normal amount.\nThe problem hit after the Thursday checkoff - there was a bug that I was not aware of that was uncovered during the checkoff that threw me for a loop for the rest of the weekend. It seemed to me that it was relatively minor, and I though I had a good handle on how to fix it until I tried to do so and could not figure out the optimal position to add in the conditional. For a bug that that seemed so minor to the user took me longer than I would like to admit to fix, and it was also frustrating to me because even after fixing the bug, it didn’t feel like there was such a huge payoff as if I had implemented something brand new.\nI did learn a few things about my debugging style however which was a good outcome of this whole process. First, I realized the importance of taking breaks. When I was racking my brain for too long at a time, I got easily frustrated and then could not think clearly. Taking a break to get out of the lab and get some fresh air, or doing some other work to excersize some other muscles in my brain would then help me come back to the debugging process with some fresh perspective. Also, talking it out with classmates and TAs was super helpful also. They were able to give me some new ideas and fresh looks at my design which ultimately helped me be more creative with my solution.\nOverall, while I did not enjoy this lab (lol) I do appreciate the fact that I was able to do it and feel proud of myself for sticking it out through the weekend rather than just giving up and leaving the lab as is."

    "text": "This week, we worked on Lab 1, where we soldered and assembled our boards and tested it by making LED sequences and powering a 7-segment display.\nSome learnings I had for this week:\nFirst, START EARLY! I wouldn’t even say I started late persay, but I feel like I could have eased more stress just by alloting more time earlier to prep for the rest of the week. For example, I started soldering my board over the weekend, but did not anticipate how difficult I would find it and thus, how much time it would take. While I still had plenty of time to finish the lab, it would have been good for me to go in a little earlier to gauge.\nSecond, work with other people! Just having friends around me in the lab eased stress because we could struggle together. We could also bounce ideas off each other when things were going wrong, and overall just made the experience more enjoyable. It was also fun to achieve little bits of the lab when I had a friend to celebtrate little wins with.\nLastly, trust the process - the process of building block diagrams and really following the design process through actually helped a lot. At first, I thought I could skip some setup steps and side tutorials in the lab to save some time, but when I got confused later on it just ended up taking more time for me to hunt for answers. I think spreading the lab out would also help with this so I wouldn’t feel so strapped for time and would be ok with going through each of the smaller steps.\nThanks for reading this reflection! Looking forward to next week!"

    "text": "For Lab 3, we used an FPGA to scan inputs from a keypad and display outputs sequentially on a double 7-segment dispplay. There were lots of little caveats to the design that accounted for weird button pressing on the part of the user. A key part of this lab was that each key should only register once, regardless for how long it was pressed and if another button was pressed at the same time. These two things affected the way I designed my lab greatly, because we had to account for many different situations in a clever way.\nThis lab took a lot of pre-thinking and planning in order to fully understand the complexities of what we were tasked to do. In order to start the lab, I started by making an Finite State Machine to understand the flow of the design and what would occur in each state of the design.\n\n\n\nFSM for state logic\n\n\nTo handle switch debouncing, I initialized counters in State 8 that would increment depending on if the button was pressed/unpressed on the clock cycle. If the counterOn fills up first, then the design will transition forward to actually displaying digits, however, if counterOn fills up first, the the deisgn will reset back to State 0 beacuse the design notices that a button is no longer pressed. This was the most logical way I could think of to ensure that debouncing would not throw off the entire design, and works because it allows for this to be contained in one state. I chose to implement it in the software rather than doing hardware switch debouncing (with a RC-circuit) because I thought that the discharging of the capacitor as a debouncing counter would not be as reliable.\nFinal schematics and block diagrams of the Verilog are shown below.\n\n\n\nSchematic of 4x4 keypad and 2 7-segment displays with pins labeled\n\n\n\n\n\nBlock diagram for Verilog of 4x4 keypad and 2 7-segment displays with pins labeled\n\n\nI am glad that I started off finalizing the Verilog through simulation before starting the hardware portion.

I did not really have many problems wiring up the hardware and getting it to work similar to the simulation which was mostly due to the thorough work I did leading up to hardware implementation.\nHowever, debugging towards the final stages was where I ran into a lot of problems. I spoke about it in my reflection for this week, but I had a small bug where pressing other buttons in the same row triggered a display of the first button. I spent a great amount of time addressing this bug. Knowing that it would be a minor fix, I still struggled to find exactly where in my Verilog the edit needed to be made. I did not spend enough time really thinking about WHY the problem was occurring and jumped straight into debugging because I felt like I was so close to being done with the lab. I think skipping over the understanding step ultimately meant I spent way more time on debugging than needed.\nUltimately, I learned a lot from this lab both about handling very complex projects and also about my debugging style."

I am surprised honestly that I felt more confident for this lab and could feel my debugging and thinking skills improved from even just a week ago. I know that this will come crashing down next week during Lab 3, but it felt good to feel like I learned something and developed my skills already in such a short time.\nI definitely implemented my learnings from last week which probably helped me feel better about this lab. I coordinated times with people to go in several days before the lab was due, and I sat down and thought through the entire lab and scribbled out notes before even touching hardware or software. This initial process was super helpful for me, and I think will be super helpful to do the same going into the next lab.\nI am a little nervous going into next week becuase I have a busy weekend with tennis, clinic, and other things going on. I worry I won’t be able to get ahead on this lab like I had hoped, but we will see how it goes! I have been enjoying the routine of going into the lab in the evenings and find myself getting lost in the work and losing track of time. Honeslty, I can’t ask for much more - I’m enjoying the class and the learning process, and that’s what counts."

I also learned about the importance of taking breaks in the middle of tough and long labs - which I talked about in my previous reflection.\nI have to say I really appreciate the midway break for the labs and maybe this could be implemented for future years?
