## Keypad Scanner

This lab was hard. I had a couple really long nights in the lab, so I have core schematics and diagrams here for now for the checkoff. I will have an in depth report for check off next week, but hoping I can get the functionality of my hardware checked off now so I can take apart my board and get started on Lab 4 ASAP while I update this report in parallel.
